      <p><small>Thank you for using Circle!</small></p>
      <p><small>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, process, and disclose your information across the Circle Platform.</small></p>
      <p><small>If you see an undefined term in this Privacy Policy (such as “Listing” or “Circle Platform”), it has the same definition as outlined in our Terms of Service.</small></p>
      <p><small>When this policy mentions “Circle,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to the Circle company that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the “Data Controller”).</small></p>
      
      <ol>
        <h4><li>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</li></h4> 
        <p><small>There are three general categories of information we collect.</small></p>
        <h5>1.1 Information You Give Us.</h5> 
        <p><small>We collect information you share with us when you use the Circle Platform.</small></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Account Information.</strong> When you sign up for an Circle Account, we require certain information such as your name and email address.</small></p> 
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Profile Information.</strong> To use certain features within the Circle Platform, we may also ask you to complete a profile, which may include your phone number. Certain parts of your profile (like your profile picture, first name, and description) are a part of your public profile page, and will be publicly visible to others.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Communications with Circle and other Members.</strong> When you communicate with Circle or use the Circle Platform to communicate with other Members, we collect information about your communication and any information you choose to provide.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Other Information.</strong> You may otherwise choose to provide us information when you fill in a form, conduct a search, update or add information to your Circle Account, respond to surveys, post to community forums, participate in promotions, or use other features of the Circle Platform.</small></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>1.2 Information We Automatically Collect from Your Use of the Circle Platform.</h5>
        <p><small>When you use the Circle Platform, we collect information about the services you use and how you use them.</small></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your interactions with the Circle Platform, such as the pages or other content you view, your searches for Listings, bookings you have made, and other actions on the Circle Platform.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Location Information.</strong> When you use certain features of the Circle Platform, we may collect different types of information about your general location (e.g. IP address, zip code) or more specific location information (e.g. precise location from your mobile GPS). Most mobile devices allow you to control or disable the use of location services for applications in the device’s settings menu.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Log Data.</strong> We automatically collect log information when you use the Circle Platform, even if you have not created an Circle Account or logged in. That information includes, among other things: details about how you’ve used the Circle Platform (including links to third party applications), IP address, access times, hardware and software information, device information, device event information (e.g., crashes, browser type), and the page you’ve viewed or engaged with before or after using the Circle Platform.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Transaction Information.</strong> We collect information related to your transactions on the Circle Platform, including the date and time, amounts charged, and other related transaction details.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</strong> We use cookies and other similar technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, and mobile identifiers. We may also allow our business partners to use these tracking technologies on the Circle Platform, or engage others to track your behavior on our behalf. While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, we do not change our practices in response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application. For more information on our use of these technologies, see our Cookie Policy.</small></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>1.3 Information We Collect from Third Parties.</h5>
        <p><small>We may collect information that others provide about you when they use the Circle Platform, or obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Circle Platform.</small></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Third Party Services.</strong> If you link, connect, or login to your Circle Account with a third party service (e.g., Facebook), the third party service may send us information such as your registration and profile information from that service. This information varies and is controlled by that service or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Other Sources.</strong> To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data or fraud detection information, from third party service providers and/or partners, and combine it with information we have about you. For example, we may receive background check results or fraud warnings from service providers like identity verification services for our fraud prevention and risk assessment efforts. We may receive information about you and your activities on and off the Circle Platform through partnerships, or about your experiences and interactions from our partner ad networks.</small></p>

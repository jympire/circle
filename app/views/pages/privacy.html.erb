      <h2 class="visible-xs visible-sm">Privacy Policy</h2>

      <br>
    
      <p><small>Thank you for using Circle!</small></p>
      <p><small>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, process, and disclose your information across the Circle Platform.</small></p>
      <p><small>If you see an undefined term in this Privacy Policy (such as “Listing” or “Circle Platform”), it has the same definition as outlined in our Terms of Service.</small></p>
      <p><small>When this policy mentions “Circle,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to the Circle company that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the “Data Controller”).</small></p>
      
      <ol>
        <h4><li>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</li></h4> 
        <p><small>There are three general categories of information we collect.</small></p>
        <h5>1.1 Information You Give Us.</h5> 
        <p><small>We collect information you share with us when you use the Circle Platform.</small></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Account Information.</strong> When you sign up for an Circle Account, we require certain information such as your name and email address.</small></p> 
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Profile Information.</strong> To use certain features within the Circle Platform, we may also ask you to complete a profile, which may include your phone number. Certain parts of your profile (like your profile picture, first name, and description) are a part of your public profile page, and will be publicly visible to others.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Communications with Circle and other Members.</strong> When you communicate with Circle or use the Circle Platform to communicate with other Members, we collect information about your communication and any information you choose to provide.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Other Information.</strong> You may otherwise choose to provide us information when you fill in a form, conduct a search, update or add information to your Circle Account, respond to surveys, post to community forums, participate in promotions, or use other features of the Circle Platform.</small></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>1.2 Information We Automatically Collect from Your Use of the Circle Platform.</h5>
        <p><small>When you use the Circle Platform, we collect information about the services you use and how you use them.</small></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your interactions with the Circle Platform, such as the pages or other content you view, your searches for Listings, bookings you have made, and other actions on the Circle Platform.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Location Information.</strong> When you use certain features of the Circle Platform, we may collect different types of information about your general location (e.g. IP address, zip code) or more specific location information (e.g. precise location from your mobile GPS). Most mobile devices allow you to control or disable the use of location services for applications in the device’s settings menu.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Log Data.</strong> We automatically collect log information when you use the Circle Platform, even if you have not created an Circle Account or logged in. That information includes, among other things: details about how you’ve used the Circle Platform (including links to third party applications), IP address, access times, hardware and software information, device information, device event information (e.g., crashes, browser type), and the page you’ve viewed or engaged with before or after using the Circle Platform.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Transaction Information.</strong> We collect information related to your transactions on the Circle Platform, including the date and time, amounts charged, and other related transaction details.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</strong> We use cookies and other similar technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, and mobile identifiers. We may also allow our business partners to use these tracking technologies on the Circle Platform, or engage others to track your behavior on our behalf. While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, we do not change our practices in response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application. For more information on our use of these technologies, see our Cookie Policy.</small></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>1.3 Information We Collect from Third Parties.</h5>
        <p><small>We may collect information that others provide about you when they use the Circle Platform, or obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Circle Platform.</small></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Third Party Services.</strong> If you link, connect, or login to your Circle Account with a third party service (e.g., Facebook), the third party service may send us information such as your registration and profile information from that service. This information varies and is controlled by that service or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small><strong>Other Sources.</strong> To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data or fraud detection information, from third party service providers and/or partners, and combine it with information we have about you. For example, we may receive background check results or fraud warnings from service providers like identity verification services for our fraud prevention and risk assessment efforts. We may receive information about you and your activities on and off the Circle Platform through partnerships, or about your experiences and interactions from our partner ad networks.</small></p>

        <h5>3.1 With Your Consent.</h5>
        <p><small>We may share your information at your direction or as described at the time of sharing, such as when you authorize a third party application or website to access your Circle Account.</small></p>
        <h5>3.2 Sharing between Hosts and Guests.</h5>
        <p><small>To help facilitate bookings, we may share your information with other Members as follows:</small></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><small>When you as a Guest submit a booking request, certain information about you is shared with the Host including your full name and other information you agree to share.</small></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><small>We don’t share your billing and payout information with other Members.</small></p>
        <h5>3.3 Profiles, Listings, and other Public Information.</h5>
        <p><small>The Circle Platform lets you publish information that is visible to the general public. For example:</small></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><small>Parts of your public profile page, such as your first name and your description are publicly visible to others.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small>Public Listing pages are publicly visible and include information such as the Accommodation's location, Listing description, calendar availability, the Host public profile photo and any additional information the Host chooses to share.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small>After completing a booking, Guests and Hosts may write reviews and rate each other. Reviews are a part of your public profile page.</small></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><small>If you submit content in a public forum or social media post, or use a similar feature on the Circle Platform, that content is publicly visible.</small></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>3.4 Service Providers.</h5>
        <p><small>We use a variety of third party service providers to help us provide services related to the Circle Platform. Service providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For example, service providers may help us: (i) verify or authenticate your identification, (ii) check information against public databases, (iii) assist us with background checks, fraud prevention, and risk assessment, or (iv) provide customer service, advertising, or payments services. These providers have limited access to your information to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually obligated to use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.</small></p>
        <h5>3.5 Safety and Compliance with Law.</h5>
        <p><small>Circle may disclose your information to courts, law enforcement or governmental authorities, or authorized third parties, if and to the extent we are required to do so by law or if such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with legal process and to respond to claims asserted against Circle, (ii) to respond to verified requests relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our users to legal liability, (iii) to enforce and administer our Terms of Service or other agreements with Members, (iv) for fraud investigation and prevention, risk assessment, customer support, product development and debugging purposes, or (v) to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Circle, its employees, its Members, or members of the public.</small></p>
        <p><small>We will attempt to notify Members about these requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon Circle’s property, its Members and the Platform (collectively, “Risk Scenarios”). In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that Member about the request after the fact if we determine in good faith that we are no longer legally prohibited from doing so and that no Risk Scenarios apply.</small></p>
        <h5>3.6 Widgets.</h5>
        <p><small>We may display parts of the Circle Platform (e.g., your Listing page) on sites operated by Circle’s business partners, using technologies such as widgets or APIs. If your Listings are displayed on a partner’s site, information from your public profile page may also be displayed.</small></p>
        <h5>3.7 Tax Authorities.</h5>
        <p><small>In jurisdictions where we facilitate the Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes as described in the “Taxes” section of the Terms of Service, Hosts and Guests expressly grant us permission, without further notice, to disclose Hosts’ and Guests’ data and other information relating to them or to their transactions, bookings, Accommodations and Occupancy Taxes to the relevant tax authority, including, but not limited to, the Host or Guest’s name, listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes received (or due) by Hosts from Guests, and contact information.</small></p>
        <h5>3.8 Aggregated Data.</h5>
        <p><small>We may also share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and non-personally identifiable information for industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.</small></p>
        <h4><li>OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</li></h4>
        <h5>4.1 Analyzing your Communications.</h5>
        <p><small>We may review, scan, or analyze your communications on the Circle Platform for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research, and customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we scan and analyze messages to mask contact information and references to other websites. In some cases, we may also scan, review, or analyze messages to debug, improve, and expand product offerings. We use automated methods where reasonably possible. However, occasionally we may need to manually review some communications, such as for fraud investigations and customer support, or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated tools. We will not review, scan, or analyze your communications to send third party marketing messages to you, and we will not sell reviews or analyses of these communications.</small></p>
        <h5>4.2 Google Maps/Earth.</h5>
        <p><small>Parts of the Circle Platform use Google Maps/Earth services, including the Google Maps API(s). Use of Google Maps/Earth is subject to Google Maps/Earth Additional Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.</small></p>
        <h4><li>THIRD PARTY PARTNERS & INTEGRATIONS</li></h4>
        <p><small>The Circle Platform may contain links to third party websites or services, such as third party integrations, co-branded services, or third party-branded services (“Third Party Partners”). Circle doesn’t own or control these Third Party Partners and when you interact with them, you may be providing information directly to the Third Party Partner, Circle, or both. These Third Party Partners will have their own rules about the collection, use, and disclosure of information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the other websites you visit.</small></p>
        <h4><li>YOUR CHOICES</li></h4>
        <h5>6.1 Access and Update.</h5>
        <p><small>You may review, update, or delete the information in your Circle Account by logging into your Circle Account and reviewing your Account settings and profile.</small></p>
        <h5>6.2 Account Cancellation.</h5>
        <p><small>Please email us if you wish to cancel you account. Note that information that you have shared with others (like Reviews or forum postings) may continue to be publicly visible on the Circle Platform in association with your first name, even after your Circle Account is cancelled.</small></p>
        <h4><li>SECURITY</li></h4>
        <p><small>We are continuously implementing and updating administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration. However, the Internet is not a 100% secure environment so we can’t guarantee the security of the transmission or storage of your information.</small></p>
        <h4><li>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</li></h4>
        <p><small>Circle reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time in accordance with this provision. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on the Circle Platform and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We will also provide you with notice of the modification by email at least thirty (30) days before the date they become effective. If you disagree with the revised Privacy Policy, you may cancel your Account. If you do not cancel your Account before the date the revised Privacy Policy becomes effective, your continued access or use of the Circle Platform will constitute acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</small></p>
        <h4><li>CONTACT</li></h4>
        <p><small>If you have any questions or complaints about this Privacy Policy or Circle’s information handling practices, you may contact us at: support@circle.fit.</small></p>

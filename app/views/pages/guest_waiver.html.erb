        <p><small>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND FREELY ASSUME ALL RISKS, BOTH KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, OF PARTICIPATING IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, EVEN IF THOSE RISKS ARISE FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OR CARELESSNESS OF THE HOST OR OTHERS, OR DEFECTS IN THE EQUIPMENT, PREMISES, OR FACILITIES USED DURING THE ACCOMMODATION, OR OTHERWISE, AND YOU ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR PARTICIPATION.</small></p>
